    <h1>What is Kairos</h1>

    <p class="page-intro">
      Kairos 360 Academy is Gestamp’s capability platform to standardize digital skills, accelerate adoption on the shopfloor
      and deliver measurable operational impact through a scalable learning model.

        <div class="about-title">Why it exists</div>
        <p>
          Plants evolve at different speeds. Kairos reduces variability by creating a shared learning standard,
          aligned with manufacturing priorities and real operational needs.
        </p>

      <div class="about-card">
        <div class="about-title">What makes it different</div>
        <p>
          Kairos focuses on implementation, not only content. Each module connects learning to shopfloor execution,
          measurable outcomes and continuous improvement.

        <div class="about-title">How it scales</div>
        <p>
          A 360° cycle and internal trainer model allow cross-plant replication, certification and governance
          with visibility for leadership.
